Thank you for buying my method! Hopefully y'all can make good use of it! :)

[1] Right-click rbxLaunch.html & edit "//672249327" to your place ID. KEEP THE "//" !
[2] Get an auto-refresh Chrome extension.
This one is pretty good: http://twineer.com/3P8l
[3] Open the html file in Chrome.
[4] Open the extension, and set the seconds to "15" or longer, depending on how fast your computer is.
[5] Now just keep the page open!

DISCLAIMER: Sometimes it will say something like "failed to connect to game," don't worry, it will still register the visit.
DISCLAIMER [2]: You must have rbxLuanchString.js in the same folder as rbxLaunch.html

Thanks to this guy for the main source, I edited it of course to cause the loop.
